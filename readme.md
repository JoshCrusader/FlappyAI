# FLAPPY BIRD AI
A flappy bird game simulated developed using only html5 canvas.
The game has an A.I. of initially (250) bots trying their best to get as far as they can in the game. This A.I. implements the method of Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) which is a genetic algorithm that incorporates a neural network in its process.

## Main concepts of genetic algorithm (For review):
- Heredity - Species of the new generation is able to inherit genes (information) of the fittest parents of the previous generation
- Variation
- Selection

## The topology of the neural network

##Initial Parameters:
- Population: 250
- Parents: 2
- Mutation rate: 0.09


This was developed to be a mini project for me to understand
